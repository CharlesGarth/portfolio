**Remote** UK based senior full stack software developer / engineer with 10+ years of programming experience.

**Generalist** approach to software development, maximum flexibility helps me take on a huge range of technical challenges - I've honed my ability to pick up and understand new languages, technologies and code bases. I follow up-to-date best practices, whether that's fixing bugs, optimising code or architecting greenfield projects, I build high quality output.

**Leadership** experience and agile project management, I was previously Head of Process at [Univers Labs](https://universlabs.co.uk) and Scrum Master at [B2M Solutions](https://b2msolutions.com). I've taken on many trainees, upskilled entire teams and been a line manager.

**My goal is to build software in the best possible way - no matter how ambitious or complex - everything is possible!**
