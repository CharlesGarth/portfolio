This ones definitely the “coolest” project I’ve worked on. One of my first projects when I started at Univers Labs, Los Angeles based cannabis company Aperture Brands commissioned us to build a fully functional automated e-commerce platform with a twist. It not only needed the ultra slick and trendy visuals on the front end to communicate Aperture’s amazing brands but also it need a complex backend that integrated with an age verification system, a delivery slot manager, a last mile delivery provider (where drivers could pickup and deliver the product to the end customer anywhere in LA) and also an integration with METRC - California State’s cannabis seed to sale track and trace system - getting that automated integration working right was critical!
