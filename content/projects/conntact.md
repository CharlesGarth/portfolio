During my time at Univers Labs I worked with a number of talented designers, one of my favourite designs was for Xenon Arc’s new version of their Conntact project. The colours and UX of the graphs and data really helped modernise the product and working within the design language of this project was really satisfying.

My contribution to this product was building the Operations and Marketing sections which showed the overview and details of KPIs, purchases and current values of marketing campaigns and their impact. I built the export feature, to XLSX and CSV as well as a re-work the graphs and visualisations on the Sales section, which showed data from several of Xenon Arc’s end clients to help them stay up to speed on the current sales of products and predicted sales in the future. I also contributed a re-implementation of how time zones were handled by the dashboard, which as with most time zone based programming was a real challenge.

The data required significant manipulation to get it into a processable place in order to visualise it. Tables across the SQL Server instance were organised into several key views that helped us aggregate data for specific purposes into manageable slices. Some complex SQL queries were needed to get the selection and data dependencies as efficiently as we could. KNEX was a big help in handling the syntax which left us to focus on the logic and correctness of the queries.
